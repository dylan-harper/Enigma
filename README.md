# enigma
## Functionality
* Meets expectations. Encrypt and Decrypt methods run properly, CLI runs (although decrypted.txt requires some hard coding).*
## OOP
* Meets expectations. Incorporated inheritance, modules, and made numerous classes to encapsulate data. *
## Conventions, Mechanics
* Between Meets and below expectations. Classes are properly formatted and indented, but modules are too long. *
## TDD
* Meets expectations. Test coverage is over 99%. Classes have their own spec files, individual methods have their own unit tests. *
## VC
* Project has 30+ commits *
