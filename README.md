## Functionality
* Meets expectations. Encrypt and Decrypt methods run properly, CLI runs with no issues I can find.
## OOP
* Meets expectations. Incorporated inheritance, modules, and made numerous classes to encapsulate data. Encrypt and Decrypt methods use helper methods. Some helper methods have their own helper methods. 
## Conventions, Mechanics
* Meets expectations. Tried to make code readable. Classes are properly formatted and indented. My own criticism is for move_encrypt / move_decrypt methods that are long and not necessarily DRY. I couldn't find a way to use helper methods because I was sharing block variables between the enumerables. 
## TDD
* Meets expectations. Test coverage is over 99%. Classes have their own spec files, individual methods have their own unit tests. Helper methods have unit tests.
## VC
* Project has 30+ commits
